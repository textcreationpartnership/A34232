            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THough in every Moneth there be made ſuch numerous Examples, and ſo many juſtly Executed; yet ſo hardned are Offenders grown, that they will take no warning, either by the Juſtice inflicted on others, or the Mercy formerly vouchſafed to themſelves, but run on in the ſame courſe of Impiety; and thoſe that were crowding Spectators at one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, come themſelves to Suffer at the nex. Which is credibly reported to have been ſeveral of theſe miſerable, Wretches Caſe, ſome of them being after laſt Seſſions obſerved to be very diligent to get places, to ſee the Priſoners go to Suffer, and others in the mean time no leſs buſie in Picking of Pockets amongſt the Crowd. Yet we muſt do the preſent Sufferers that right, as to ſay, That after Condemnation they generally behaved themſelves very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, and with a ſober Deportment lamenting their ill-ſpent Lives, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and crying out of the multitude and heinouſneſs of their Sins, and imploring the Mercy and Pardon of Almighty God through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Some of them ripp'd up and declared the ſeries and tracks of wickedneſs, which they had followed from their Youth, diſcovering ſuch variety of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Offences, that one would have thought it almoſt impoſſible, that perſons of their Age could have been ſuch vaſt Proficients in Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Several of them had been under Sentence of Death before, and now too late they remembred thoſe ſolemn Vows which they then made to Heaven, to forſake their lewd Courſes, if God and the King would but have Mercy upon them, and ſave their Lives at that time: But when their Prayers were heard, no ſooner were they abroad, but they were far more wicked than ever before. Theſe dreadful Aggravations now lay heavy upon their Spirits, and they did deſire all that came to ſee them, to beware of the like horrible Impiety, that they would not abuſe Mercy, nor neglect their Vows made in the time of Diſtreſs; for God will not be mocked.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:44760:2"/>
            <p>On Sunday the twenty fifth inſtant, the Ordinary both forenoon and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, took great pains with theſe Condemned Malefactors, in two excellent Sermons, to bring them to a ſenſe of their ſins; and it was obſerved, that the greateſt part of them gave their attention with much more ſeriouſneſs, than ſome others in their Circumſtances heretofore were wont to do.</p>
            <p>There were a great number of Clippers and Coyners Arraigned at this Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof ſeveral were Convicted, others Acquitted: of the former ſort were Mrs <hi>Richardſon</hi> and her Son, a brisk bold young fellow, and pretending himſelf a Dancing-maſter; another woman was Indicted with them, but Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. Mrs. <hi>Richardſon</hi> had brought a Trunk lockt to this other womans houſe, and ſet it obſcurely under the Cellar-ſtairs; in this Trunk there were found the Tools for Clipping; likewiſe at home when ſhe was taken, there were ſome Clippings diſcovered, and ſhe cryed out of a window, and ſaid, <hi>ſhe was undone;</hi> and the Son endeavoured to fly for it, ſo that they were found guilty.</p>
            <p>One <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwood,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Cook</hi> a Wench he kept company with (a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteous Lady, for at the Bar ſhe boaſted, ſhe never had been unkind to any man in her life) were likewiſe Convicted of High-Treaſon for the like offence, much clipt Money and Clippings, and, the neceſſary Implements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found upon them. Both theſe and two former lived near <hi>Pickadilly,</hi> and 'tis ſuppoſed, were all of a gang, or had converſation together; they were firſt diſcovered by means of an old Companion, to whom this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwoods</hi> Miſtreſs boaſted, that ſhe could get a Guinney a day by this Myſtery; and told him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething of the way. The Woman being ſuppoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the chief Inticer to this villany, was ſentenced to be Burnt.</p>
            <p>Another perſon who drove the ſame Trade alone by himſelf, was alſo found guilty: the matter was proved ſo plainly on him, that there could be no doubt or difficulty made of it. But His Majeſty, who is wholly compoſed of Grace and Clemency, was pleaſed to Reprieve ſeveral of theſe Offenders.</p>
            <p>A perſon living in or near <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> and his Wife, were likewiſe charged with the ſame Offence: The Evidence for the King made out ſeveral preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them, but there was a multitude of their Neighbours and others that came in to teſtifie as to their Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Priſoners alledged, the proſecution was upon an old grudge, and endeavoured to recriminate upon one of the chief Evidence; it did appear that four years ago, their Houſe had been ſearched on ſuſpition of this Crime of Clipping, and then nothing found that could render them obnoxious to the Law, ſo that after a full and fair Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they were acquitted.</p>
            <p>Several perſons, as is uſual every Seſſions, were Convicted for ſtealing of ſilver Tankards, and divers for Shop-lifting, the particulars too tedious to relate.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Daniel Mackarty,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> was Tryed and Convicted of Treaſon, as being a Popiſh Prieſt: the manner of his Apprehenſion was thus. A woman in <hi>Charles-ſtreet</hi> being very ſick, this Father officiated with her, ſaid Maſs, and Adminiſtred the Sacrament to her, of which the Nurſe gave notice to ſome honeſt Neighbours, who took out a Warrant and ſeized him in the ſaid ſick womans Chamber, who much interceded and begged that they would not take him away, and furiouſly Crying out, <hi>O will ye rob me of my Salvation;</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44760:2"/>but they adviſed her to ſend for a Proteſtant Divine, and take inſtructions from him, and not to truſt ſuch blind Popiſh guides, with their Idolatrous Maſſes, and fooliſh Ceremonies of Extream Unction and groundleſs Abſolutions, where there is neither true Faith or Repentance. The Nurſe teſtified that ſhe had heard the Priſoner ſay Maſs, and exerciſe other parts of the Prieſtly Function. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> likewiſe was a Witneſs againſt him, that he confeſſed to him that he was a Prieſt when he was brought to his Chamber. In his Pocket when he was taken, there was found a Petition to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, expreſſed by the name of <hi>Daniel Mackarty</hi> Prieſt, ſetting forth his being in want, and deſiring relief; as likewiſe a Letter in <hi>French</hi> directed to him, and ſignifying likewiſe, that he was a Prieſt; which Papers were read in Court. He had little to ſay for himſelf, but behaved himſelf impudently, calling the Witneſſes ſcurrilous names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nothing could be made more plain than his Prieſthood, which in truth he ſcarce denyed, and ſo was found guilty, which he ſeemed not at all to regard, being a perſon (as moſt of them are) of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful confidence.</p>
            <p>The Petition before-mentioned was in French, and therein it was ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Order he was of; likewiſe there was another Paper in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, purporting to be directions how (if he were taken) he ſhould behave himſelf, what excuſes and pretences he ſhould make, what he ſhould ſay if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> or any other of the Kings Evidence; whereby we may ſee they have Leſſons ſet them in every caſe. He thought to have baffled the woman that gave Evidence againſt him, by asking her what cloaths he had on when ſhe heard him officiate; who anſwered, the ſame he had now; whence he would infer that it could not be, becauſe in ſaying Maſs, they uſe ſuch and ſuch Veſtments; but this was quickly contradicted, for though he had not all his Formalities, which they cannot conveniently always, nor ſafely now eſpecially, carry abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ith them, yet to ſupply that defect, there was found about him, and now ſhewed in Court, a thing called in their holy <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beriſh, A Stole,</hi> being a piece of Sattin or Taffata, of near two yards long, and three or four Inches broad, of a kind of deep blew, or almoſt purple colour, which they uſe to fling over their ſhoulders, and that alone ſerves inſtead of all the reſt of their gear. The woman mentioning her hearing him ſay Maſs, was askt how many were preſent, ſhe anſwered, ſhe could not certainly tell, but was ſure there was above threeſcore; and being demanded if ſhe knew any of them, replyed, yes, there were enough of them now about the Court, or in the yard, or words to that effect.</p>
            <p>There was a young Gentleman of good note, took a Tryal on the <hi>Friday</hi> touching a Rape charg'd to be committed on the Daughter of one Mrs. a Girl about ten years of age. He was ordered by a Relation to demand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of this Childs Parents, who kept an Ale-houſe, and they contriv'd, as may be thought, this Stratagem not onely to ſatisfie that Debt, but ſcrew more Money out of him. The Girl told the ſtory that he meddled with her in the Chamber at her Mothers; and her Siſter a wench about ſixteen years of age confirm'd it, by ſaying ſhe came up and ſaw it, and that he gave her two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to hold her tongue; and Midwives ſwore the Child had had ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe. But the Gentleman proved by a Servant-maid, that the eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter went abroad, pickt up a man, brought him home, who went to bed with both her and her Siſter, and began with the leaſt firſt, ſo that then ſhe cry'd out and might receive the prejudice. Twas alſo prov'd, that they would fain have made a Compoſition for one hundred and ſixty pound, and then they would put it up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that upon the whole matter, the Gentleman was fairly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44760:3"/>
            <p>But as to the reſt of the 24 perſons condemned this Seſſions, they were all (except the 9 named here before in the Title-page) Reprieved.</p>
            <p>The Behaviour of moſt of thoſe in the priſon after Sentence, was, as we ſaid, very penitent; eſpecially <hi>Henry Weller,</hi> condemned for ſtealing a Mare, and formerly Tranſported, was remarkable, ſpending his whole time in Reading, Prayers, and Exhortations to his fellow priſoners. Early in the morning before he ſuffered, he prayed with them above an hour very heartily, and with expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſuitable to their condition: wherein they ſeemed affectionately to joyn, and to receive much comfort thereby; they all immediately after ſinging praiſes to God with a Pſalm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Harding,</hi> for that deteſtable Violence and Rape committed on a poor childe, appear'd the moſt hardned and refractory perſon amongſt them all. No perſwaſions or intreaties of Miniſters or others that came to viſit him, could bring him to relent; but as he lived like a Brute, ſo to outward appearance he ſeemed not ſo ſenſible of his condition and approaching end, as might have been hoped for from the means that were uſed with him.</p>
            <p>The women, <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Soams,</hi> were old offenders, had many times been in <hi>New-gate,</hi> and often received Mercy: they now lamentably bewailed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and expreſſed much ſorrow for their ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralph Cook</hi> was convicted of Treaſon, for counterfeiting the Kings Coyn, making Mill'd Half-Crowns out of Pewter-plate; part of which Pewter, and ſeven of the Half Crowns, with divers Tools for the purpoſe, were found in his Lodging. He was firſt diſcovered by means of his wife, who gave ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof to his Landlord. He confeſſed that he was drawn into this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal practice by a certain perſon in <hi>Stafford</hi>-ſhire, who 'tis ſaid is ſome time ſince dead. He behaved himſelf ſoberly after Sentence, except onely when tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with paſſion at his wife, whom yet in words he did forgive, and prayed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times that God would forgive him his ſins, and put his heart into a frame of charity towards her and all others.</p>
            <p>At the place of Execution none of them made any ſet Speech, but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confeſſed their ſins, and warn'd all the Spectators to take example by them, to avoid Ill company, Drunkenneſs, Swearing, profanation of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Diſcourſes common on ſuch occaſions, but 'tis a thouſand pities they are no more regarded: for if they were, we ſhould not ſee ſo many daily come to ſuch an Ignominious <hi>End.</hi>
